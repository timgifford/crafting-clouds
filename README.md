# Declarative Cloud Crafting with CloudFormation and Terraform

## Abstract
There are 3 general techniques to manage your cloud resources:

 - Manual - using the online tools and a mouse
 - Imperative - using the AWS CLI/SDK and a script to declare **how** to create your infrastructure
 - Declarative - using tools like CloudFormation or Terraform to declare **what** you need for infrastructure

In this talk Tim Gifford will focus on comparing the declarative tools, CloudFormation and Terraform.

In this talk you will:
 - Learn the key features of each tool
 - Hear about similarities and differences between the tools
 - See live demos that create, update and delete cloud stacks
 - Discuss with other attendees their experience with these tools

Tim Gifford is a software delivery coach with Lean TECHniques. He specializes in leading and mentoring teams in  XP, Lean, Agile and DevOps.
